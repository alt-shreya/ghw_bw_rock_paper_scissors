# Rock, Paper, Scissors
The classic game, reimagined with Python, for ~lonely people~ the adventurous few who dare to take a stand against a know-it-all calculator. Will they be successful? Only one way to find out...

## How to Play
Download the file and execute the Python file in your terminal of choice, like so:
```bash

$ python3 rock_paper_scissors.py
